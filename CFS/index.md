Carbon credit suffers from the "double credit" problem, which is similar to the double spending problem on blockchains.

This occurs when someone sequester some carbon and "resale" the credit several time.
as it is difficult to prove where the carbon goes unless it is "shipped" as by products

To avoid the shipping or carbon around, we can tokenize every capture, and keep a book on
all carbon capture on a globally recognized ledger.

One straight forward way is to have a fixed universally approved format for carbon capture reporting,
where each record can be audited. If the format is fixed there can't be 2 different ways to identify a record
and a hash (SHA256) of a canonical file can be used to locate and fully identified it.
(no credit is released if the "hash" is already spent !!!)
