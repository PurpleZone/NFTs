Our current governance is flawed, our living condition have worsen,
and the life is endanger due to so many irresponsible behavior
We are commited to make a change in this world.

We believe we have to roll up our sleves as it would not come form our gouverments
they have demonstrated over the paste years they are unable to serve our (general) interrest.

What to do ?
There is power in joining forces, we have readily available social tools,
communication technologies, immense knowledege sharing capability,
if carefully orchestrated we can address and solve any problem we want
(yes any...)

We can stop wars, transition to a no fossil economy, reestablish healthy commerce and support
between nations etc.

What does it takes ? simply rallying behind a same goal, gathering critical mass to act.
when we are acting in synergy to solve a given probleme we have consensue...
we are innovative we are the solution and nothing can stop us from delivering it.


We are the people, we can set the rules how we want our world to be.

I pick a better one! who's with me ?
