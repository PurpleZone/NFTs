## Green Coin as a replacement for bitcoin

This project is about burring carbon in the ground from bitcoin mining emissions.

We believe there is no other way that pairing crypto to a "regenerative project"
that will restore health of the people and or our ecosystem...
by storing away Carbon back in Nature energy reserve (planting tree, using algea, ...
refertilizing nature soil etc.)

Paying a tax or using carbon credit won't do it, as it has been demonstrated the contribute
to only green washing.


Please KEEP fossils in the ground ... and support life and the purple (zero waste) industry.
